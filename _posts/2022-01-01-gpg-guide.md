**GPG** aka **GnuPG** aka **Gnu Privacy Guard**  
**GNU**: a recursive acronym meaning "_**GNU's not Unix!_**")  
  
GPG (OpenPG) is the adaption of the encryption standard known as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). It is mainly designed to use asymmetric public/private key cryptography but also has the option to symmetrically encrypt data. 

# Install
- Windows: [gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/get-gpg4win.html)  
- MacOS: `brew install gpg pinentry-mac`  
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install gnupg`  

On Windows most of the following functionality can be handled via the installed gpg4win GUI application called Kleopatra.

## Verify Installation
``` shell
gpg --version
```

# Managing Key Pairs
## Creating a Key Pair
```shell
gpg --full-generate-key
```
You will be prompted several things:
1. Keypair kind (RSA & RSA or ECC are the 2 most likely options for you)
2. Keysize (RSA), Elliptic Curve (ECC)
3. Expiration Date for the key (this can be extended manually later on, so picking a key with an expiration is the safest option in case you lose the key)
4. Name and email address
5. Comment
6. Passphrase: Choose a secure password to protect your key

## List All Keys
``` shell
gpg --list-keys
gpg --list-secret-keys // list private keys
gpg --fingerprint      //list all fingerprints
```

## Deleting Keys
```shell
gpg --delete-key KEYID
gpg --delete-secret-key KEYID
```
KEYID can be anything that identifies the key like the name of the owner, email, fingerprint etc.

## Exporting Keys
```shell
// Public
gpg --export --armor --output PUBLIC.asc KEYID

// Private
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor --output PRIVATE.asc KEYID
```
Without --output specified gpg will print to stdout

## Importing Keys
```shell 
// Public
gpg --import PUBLIC.key

// Private
gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import PRIVATE.asc
```

## Public Key Servers 
-   [pgp.mit.edu](http://pgp.mit.edu/)
-   [keyserver.ubuntu.com](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/)
-   [keyserver.pgp.com](https://keyserver.pgp.com/)
-   [peegeepee.com](https://peegeepee.com/)
- etc.

### Publish Public Key
```shell
gpg --send-keys --keyserver hkp://KEYSERVER KEYID
```
### Search Public Keys
```shell
gpg --keyserver hkp://KEYSERVER --search USER@DOMAIN.COM
```

Where KEYSERVER is the address of the key server like: pgp.mit.edu

## Editing Keys
```shell
gpg --edit-key KEYID
```
A interactive gpg prompt will start, get all command by entering `help`

## Import Public Key
``` shell
gpg --import recipient.key
```



## Key Trust Levels

### Signing Public Keys
``` shell
gpg --sign-key recipient@email.com
```
### Show Fingerprint of Public Key
In order to verify the key manually, you can compare the local fingerprint of the public key with a the fingerprint of the same key provided directly and securely by the recipient itself.
``` shell
gpg --fingerprint recipient@email.com
```
