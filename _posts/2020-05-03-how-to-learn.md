## Thinking Modes

|                           Focused                            |                           Diffused                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Activated by **paying attention** to what you are trying to learn. In this mode **familiar thought patterns** are used which can lead to "thinking inside the box" and not seeing the overall big picture. | Is a **relaxed** thinking style which allows you to look at things **more broadly**. Get into this mode by taking breaks, doing mundane things like cleaning your room or meditating. |

**You can't be in both modes at the same time!**

When learning something new and difficult, the mind needs to be able to go back and forth between the focused and diffused mode. <u>This helps learning effectively.</u>



## Chunking

> Mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning

### How to form a chunk?:

1. **Focus** on new Material!
2. **Understand** the basic idea
3. **Practice** to gain context
   1. Learn when and when <u>not</u> to use the chunk
   2. See the bigger Picture

Chunks play a vital role in information retention. They effectively compress and connect several areas of your study. They massively help build a bigger picture and may help you learn something in a different area faster due to small similarities.



## Avoid the Illusion of Competence

> Simply understanding the solution doesn't mean having a solid grasp

**Study, don't just look at it!**

Several steps can be taken to ensure you don't fall into this trap:

- **Test yourself**
  - Take mini-tests
  - **Recall** (Look away and try to recall as much as possible without looking at the solutions)
- **Minimize Highlighting**
  - Instead summarize key concepts by taking brief notes.
- **Make and learn from Mistakes**
  - Mistakes happen, embrace them and learn from them
- **Use deliberate Practice**
  - Focus on the next harder thing. Don't repeat stuff you've already mastered (Overlearning).
- **Interleave**
  - Practice different techniques or concepts in one session



Also be aware of your **Einstellung (Mindset)**. This is your initial Intuition can hinder you from finding other solutions. Try and keep an open Mind!



## Procrastination

> A little bit every, that's the trick

The enemy and close friend of every student. Procrastination actually activates areas in your brain associated with pain and has similarities to addiction. It is a automatic habit we are mostly unaware of.

###  Habits

1. The Cue (location, time, emotion, reactions) => **APPLY WILLPOWER HERE**
2. The Routine
3. The Reward
4. The Belief
